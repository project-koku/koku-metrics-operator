## About

Operator to obtain OCP usage data and upload it to koku. The operator utilizes [Golang](http://golang.org/) to collect usage data from an OCP cluster installation.

You must have access to an OpenShift v.4.3.0+ cluster..

## Development

This project was generated using Operator SDK. For a more in depth understanding of the structure of this repo, see the [user guide](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/building-operators/golang/quickstart/) that was used to generate it.

This project requires Go 1.13 or greater if you plan on running the operator locally. To get started developing against `korekuta-operator-go` first clone a local copy of the git repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/project-koku/korekuta-operator-go.git
```

Next, install the Operator SDK CLI using the following [documentation](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/installation/install-operator-sdk/). The operator is currently being built with the v0.19 release of the operator-sdk.

To build the manager binary you can execute the following make command:

```
make manager
```

To build the docker image you can execute the following make command:

```
make docker-build
```

Linting can be performed with the following make command:

```
make fmt
```

## Testing

Execute test by running the following make command:

```
make test
```

## Deploying the Operator

First, create the `openshift-cost` project. This is where we are going to deploy our Operator.

Before running the operator, the CRD must be registered with the Kubernetes apiserver:

```
make install
```

Once this is done, there are two ways to run the operator:

- As Go program outside a cluster
- As a Deployment inside a Kubernetes cluster

## Configuring your test environment

Projects are scaffolded with unit tests that utilize the [envtest](https://godoc.org/sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/envtest)
library, which requires certain Kubernetes server binaries be present locally.
Installation instructions can be found [here][env-test-setup].

### 1. Run locally outside the cluster

To run the operator locally execute the following command:

```sh
$ make run ENABLE_WEBHOOKS=false
```

### 2. Run as a Deployment inside the cluster

#### Build and push the image

Before building the operator image, ensure the generated Dockerfile references
the base image you want. You can change the default "runner" image `gcr.io/distroless/static:nonroot`
by replacing its tag with another, for example `alpine:latest`, and removing
the `USER: nonroot:nonroot` directive.

To build and push the operator image, use the following `make` commands.
Make sure to modify the `IMG` arg in the example below to reference a container repository that
you have access to. You can obtain an account for storing containers at
repository sites such quay.io or hub.docker.com. This example uses quay.

Build the image:
```sh
$ export USERNAME=<quay-username>

$ make docker-build IMG=quay.io/$USERNAME/korekuta-operator-go:v0.0.1
```

Push the image to a repository and make sure to set the repository to public:

```sh
$ make docker-push IMG=quay.io/$USERNAME/korekuta-operator-go:v0.0.1
```

**Note**:
The name and tag of the image (`IMG=<some-registry>/<project-name>:tag`) in both the commands can also be set in the Makefile. Modify the line which has `IMG ?= controller:latest` to set your desired default image name.

Branches of the repository are built automaticaly [here](https://quay.io/repository/project-koku/korekuta-operator-go).


#### Deploy the operator


```sh
$ cd config/default/ && kustomize edit set namespace "openshift-cost" && cd ../..
```

Run the following to deploy the operator. This will also install the RBAC manifests from `config/rbac`.

```sh
$ make deploy IMG=quay.io/$USERNAME/korekuta-operator-go:v0.0.1
```

*NOTE* If you have enabled webhooks in your deployments, you will need to have cert-manager already installed
in the cluster or `make deploy` will fail when creating the cert-manager resources.

If your current branch has been pushed to the origin repository then you can deploy your current branch with the following command.
```sh
$ make deploy-branch
```

Verify that the korekuta-operator-go is up and running:

```console
$ oc get deployment
```

## Create a CostManagement CR

Create the CR with the default token authentication:

```sh
$ make deploy-cr
```

Create the CR with basic authentication specifying a username and password:

```sh
$ make deploy-cr USER=$YOUR_USERNAME PASS=$YOUR_PASSWORD AUTH=basic
```

Review the logs for the Cost Management operator.

### Cleanup

```sh
$ oc delete -f config/samples/cost-mgmt_v1alpha1_costmanagement.yaml
$ oc delete deployments,service -l control-plane=controller-manager
$ oc delete role,rolebinding --all
```
