## Releasing a new version of the costmanagement-metrics-operator

Before releasing a new version of the operator, testing should be performed as described [here](release-testing.md).


### Create a github release and push the operator image
Create a GitHub release that corresponds with the operator release version. The [previous releases](https://github.com/project-costmanagement/costmanagement-metrics-operator/releases) can be used as a template.

Update the release version at the top of the `Makefile` to match the release version of the operator:

```
# Current Operator version
VERSION ?= <release-version>
```

> After creating the GitHub release/tag, a Quay hook should pull the image. Check the [quay repo](https://quay.io/repository/project-costmanagement/costmanagement-metrics-operator?tab=tags) and ensure the new tag was pulled. If the tag does not exist, the following should be run to build and push the image:
> ```
> make docker-build
> make docker-push
> ```

### Generate the release bundle
Run the following command to generate the release bundle:

```
make bundle CHANNELS=alpha,beta DEFAULT_CHANNEL=beta
```
This will generate a new `<release-version>` bundle inside of the `costmanagement-metrics-operator` directory within the repository.

Once the release bundle has been generated, fork & clone the [community-operators repository](https://github.com/operator-framework/community-operators). Create a branch, and copy the generated bundle to the `community-operators/community-operators/costmanagement-metrics-operator/` directory in your cloned fork.

For example, if the bundle was generated for a `1.0.0` release, the directory structure would look like the following:

```
costmanagement-metrics-operator/
├── 0.9.0
│   ├── manifests
│   │   ├── costmanagement-metrics-cfg.openshift.io_costmanagementmetricsconfigs.yaml
│   │   └── costmanagement-metrics-operator.clusterserviceversion.yaml
│   ├── metadata
│   │   └── annotations.yaml
│   └── Dockerfile
├── 1.0.0
│   ├── manifests
│   │   ├── costmanagement-metrics-cfg.v1.0.0.openshift.io_costmanagementmetricsconfigs.yaml
│   │   └── costmanagement-metrics-operator.v1.0.0.clusterserviceversion.yaml
│   ├── metadata
│   │   └── annotations.yaml
│   └── Dockerfile
```

### Create the release pull-request
Commit, sign, and push the branch to the fork of the community-operators repo. Once pushed, open a PR against the community-operators repo and fill out the resulting checklist:

```
git commit -s -m "<commit-message>"
git push origin branch
```

After completing the above steps, bump the version in the Makefile (e.g. `VERSION ?= <release-version>+1`). This will prevent accidental builds and pushes for a version that has already been released. The generated release bundle and the bumped Makefile version should be committed to the `costmanagement-metrics-operator` repo.
